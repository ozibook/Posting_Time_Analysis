### üìÅFile Details
#### 1. Excel File Format:
File Type: Ensure the file you want to process is in .xlsx format.

Columns:

URL: This column should contain URLs with embedded 19-digit post IDs. The code in this notebook will extract these post IDs to derive timestamps.

Sample Excel File Structure:

URL
https://example.com/post/1234567890123456789

#### 2. Using the Code in This Notebook:
Navigate to the cell containing the line:

input_file = "trial.xlsx"

Modify this line to point to the path of your Excel file. For example:

input_file = "path_to_your_file.xlsx"
- [Go to File‚ÜóÔ∏è] https://drive.google.com/file/u/0/d/1C8d5gYXj38MtC7MrWZBh_WZrp07EfvSZ/edit
#### 3. Running the Code:
Execute the cell containing the code by selecting it and pressing Shift + Enter.

#### 4. Checking the Results:
After the cell execution completes, open the Excel file you provided.

You should now see the 'Timestamp UTC' and 'Timestamp IST' columns populated with the extracted timestamps in human-readable date formats for each URL in the 'URL' column.

#### 5. Notes:
* The code assumes that the URLs in the 'URL' column contain a 19-digit post ID from which a Unix timestamp can be extracted.

* The extracted Unix timestamp is then converted to human-readable date formats in both UTC and IST.

* The updated data is saved back to the original Excel file.
