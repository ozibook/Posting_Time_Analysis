Excel File Format:\n","\n","File Type: Ensure the file you want to process is in .xlsx format.\n","\n","Columns:\n","\n","URL: This column should contain URLs with embedded 19-digit post IDs. The code in this notebook will extract these post IDs to derive timestamps.\n","\n","Sample Excel File Structure:\n","\n","URL\t                                                            \n","https://example.com/post/1234567890123456789\n","\n","#### 2. Using the Code in This Notebook:\n","\n","Navigate to the cell containing the line:\n","\n","input_file = \"trial.xlsx\"\n","\n","\n","Modify this line to point to the path of your Excel file. For example:\n","\n","input_file = \"path_to_your_file.xlsx\"\n","\n","\n","#### 3. Running the Code:\n","\n","Execute the cell containing the code by selecting it and pressing Shift + Enter.\n","\n","#### 4. Checking the Results:\n","\n","After the cell execution completes, open the Excel file you provided.\n","\n","You should now see the 'Timestamp UTC' and 'Timestamp IST' columns populated with the extracted timestamps in human-readable date formats for each URL in the 'URL' column.\n","\n","#### 5. Notes:\n","\n","The code assumes that the URLs in the 'URL' column contain a 19-digit post ID from which a Unix timestamp can be extracted.\n","\n","The extracted Unix timestamp is then converted to human-readable date formats in both UTC and IST.\n","\n","The updated data is saved back to the original Excel file."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"p7iY3R-6Yx0w"},"source":["# TimeStamp
